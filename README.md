# CKAN
As a data management system designed to help organizations and communities publish, share, and discover datasets, CKAN acts as a platform to manage large-scale data repositories, making it easier for users to find and access structured data. CKAN allows a creation of data portals, mainly used by government agencies to allow public access to various data (open data concept).

CKAN itself is pretty robust, with dataset publishing, discovering and interactive cabalities, with additional extensions allowing for an increase in its functionality based on specific needs.

CKAN's architecture is devided into components that interact with eachother with different technologies and protocols. Each component's functionality can be expanded with plugins without chagning the core CKAN.

## Models

CKAN primarly stores data in relational databases (most commonly used is PostgreSQL) as CKAN focuses on structured, interrelated data management.

### 1. Metadata Storage in Databases

CKAN stores metadata related to datasets, users, organizations, recources, etc. as tables in relational database. Each of these tables has relationship between them, like ``resource`` table being related to ``package`` table (representing datasets).

### 2. Storing files and Resources

CKAN can either store files directly or it can link to external files or data sources.

* **File-Based Storage**: When a file (e.g., a CSV or JSON file) is uploaded, CKAN can store the file locally on the server's filesystem or in a cloud storage. The fileâ€™s metadata (such as filename, format, and size) is stored in the resource table in the database. 
* **External URLs**: If the resource is a link to an external file (e.g., a dataset hosted on a different server or in the cloud), CKAN stores the URL in the database rather than the file itself.

### 3. DataStore Plugin

By default CKAN stores tabular data (like CSV) as raw files without the ability to query through them, meaning that users would have to download the files and analyse them offline. With additional plugins, like **DataStore**, it becomes possible to store the actual structured, queryable data from these files, alongside the metadata.

DataStore plugin is usually complimented by an additional **Datapusher** plugin. The Datapusher automatically downloads any tabular data files like CSV or Excel from a CKAN site's resources when they are added to the CKAN site, parses them to pull out the actual data, then uses the DataStore API to push the data into the CKAN site's DataStore.

While it's still possible to use DataStore plugin without Datapusher, the data extraction would have to be manual with ``ckan datastore push`` command each time a file uploaded.

### 4. Search Index (Solr)

CKAN integrates with a search engine (usually Solr) to expand its search capabilities across datasets.

Solr is built on top of Apache Lucene, a full-text search library. Solr's indexing makes searches much faster by converting raw data into a format optimized for quick searching. With Solr's multithreading, batch processing capabilities the dataset searches become faster.

## Logic

## Actions

In CKAN, actions are the core operations or tasks that can be performed through its API and user interface. They correspond to the various operations related to datasets, groups, organizations, users, and other entities managed within the CKAN system. An action request is validated, executes and a response in returned everytime it is called.

Every CKAN's plugin is called through the CKAN's Action API endpoint ``.../api/3/action/{action_name}``. Some actions examples using CKAN API:

1. Create Dataset (``package_create``)
2. Add Resources (``resource_create``)
3. Apply Tags (``tag_create`` and ``tag_show``)
4. Allow Access (``user_role_create``)
